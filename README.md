# UpsalesTestApp
An iOS app for testing the Upsales API.

## Objectives

* Fetch accounts with a limit of 100 accounts and display all account objects as separate items of a list (In the API documentation you can find accounts under endpoint “Client”)
* Create a search bar in the top of the view that searches for items in the list that match the company name
* If the user clicks on an item in the list, then show a new screen with the company name and a map with the Visit address of the company. If the visit address doesn’t exist, use the postal address in the accounts object
* Create a filter controller that filters accounts based on account manager. Do this as a new API-request and fetch accounts with a limit of 100 accounts (account managers are “users” in the account object)
